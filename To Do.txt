What's Next

Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin directory
Compile the ui file using pyuic4
Compile the resources file using pyrcc4
Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager
Customize it by editing the implementation file responseratio.py
Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png
Modify your user interface by opening responseratio.ui in Qt Designer (don't forget to compile it with pyuic4 after changing it)
You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)



Reconfigure Dialog box
	#have an execute button to allow multiple calculations to be triggered in a single dialog session Done V0.2
	#have a table of box to keep track of what elements have been calculated Done V0.2
	#Title and quick description? Done V0.2
	#help button? V0.2- added but not implemented functionality
	
Error handling and reconciliation
	*Having nulls (unless because there was no assay for that sample) and -ve values (due to values being below detection) is not appropriate for this method
	*nulls also throw errors in the calculation routine (appear in python as type "None" which cannot be accepted by the functions
		# Convert nulls to 0's on the fly. rows which were originally null still output 'null' in the result Done V0.2
		# Exclude 0's from background calculation Done V0.2
	*below detection is generally replaced with a nominal value, usually half detection
		#make error check routine that checks column for -ve values
		#if detected, trigger a dialog box to inform of this occurence, and a prompt to indicate what value should be used to replace
		#run a loop through to replace -ve with nominated value
